    "# Assignment 4: Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we will introduce two popular visualization tools commonly used in python. We will use data from the US Federal Election Commission. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular plotting libraries today is [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). According to the documentation, \"Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible.\" For the most basic plots, line graphs, single bar plots etc., matplotlib has functions for just these things.\n",
    "\n",
    "As plots get more complex, many data scientists use [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), a wrapper around matplotlib that improves on its theme, and has convenience functions for more complex plots that tend to be common. You can see a ton of examples in Seaborn's [example gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "With Matplotlib and Seaborn you often have to manually move labels, adjust axes, add data labels, etc. An alternative is declarative visualization. Akin to the difference between imperative approaches like Pandas vs declarative approaches like SQL for manipulating tabular data, declarative visualizations allow users to specify what visualization they want over their data by describing the connection between data and visual encodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we will use a python declarative visualization library, [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/), itself built atop the popular declarative visualization tool [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/), to demonstrate how to get some effective visualizations in relatively few lines of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, make sure you have chosen the right virtual environment (iap-data-venv) to run this notebook in. How to do this depends on your IDE. "
